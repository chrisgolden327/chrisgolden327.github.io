                This is the start of my experience in learning HTML, CSS, JS, and Git.
                I intend to use my experience in making this website as a place to 
                document what I learn in mechanical engineering as a student at Ohio State University.
        
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This is my first experience in making a website and I would like to thank Matt Hall for helping me get started.
