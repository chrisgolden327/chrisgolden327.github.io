            This is the start of my project and my experience in learning HTML and Git. <br/>
            I intend to use my experience in making this website as a source to 
            document what I am learning in mechanical engineering as a stuent at Ohio State University.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This is my first experience in making a website and I would like to thank Matt Hall for helping me get started.
